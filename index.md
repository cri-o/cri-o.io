### CRI-O Running Kubernetes Pods

## What is CRI-O?

CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface) to enable using
OCI (Open Container Initiative) compatible runtimes.
It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for kubernetes.
It allows Kubernetes to use any OCI-compliant
runtime as the container runtime for running pods. Today it supports runc and Clear Containers
as the container runtimes but any OCI-conformant runtime can be plugged in principle.

CRI-O supports OCI container images and can pull from any container registry.
It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker, Moby or rkt as the runtime for Kubernetes.

CRI-O is developed by maintainers and contributors from these companies and others.
It is a community-driven, open source project. Feedback, users, and of course, contributors, are always welcome at the [kubernetes-incubator/cri-o](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o) project.

## Architecture

![CRI-O architecture](assets/images/architecture.png)

The architectural components are as follows:

- Kubernetes contacts the kubelet to launch a pod.
  - Pods are a kubernetes concept consisting of one or more containers sharing the same IPC, NET and PID `namespaces` and living in the same cgroup.
- The kublet forwards the request to the CRI-O daemon VIA kubernetes CRI (Container runtime interface) to launch the new POD.
- CRI-O uses the `containers/image` library to pull the image from a container registry.
- The downloaded image is unpacked into the container's root filesystems, stored in COW file systems, using containers/storage library.
- After the rootfs has been created for the container, CRI-O generates an OCI runtime specification json file describing how to run the container using the OCI Generate tools.
- CRI-O then launches an OCI Compatible Runtime using the specification to run the container proceses. The default OCI Runtime is runc.
- Each container is monitored by a separate `conmon` process. The conmon process holds the `pty` of the PID1 of the container process.  It handles logging for the container and records the exit code for the container process.
- Networking for the pod is setup through use of [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni), so any CNI plugin can be used with CRI-O.

## Components

CRI-O is made up of several components that are found in different GitHub repositories.

* [OCI compatible runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools)
* [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage)
* [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image)
* [networking (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)
* [container monitoring (conmon)](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/tree/master/conmon)
* security is provided by several core Linux capabilities

### OCI compatible runtimes

CRI-O supports any [OCI compatible runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools).
We test with runc and Clear Containers today.

### Storage

The [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage) library is used for managing layers
and creating root file-systems for the containers in a pod: `Overlayfs`, `devicemapper`, `AUFS` and `btrfs`
are implemented, with `Overlayfs` as the default driver.

Support for network based file system images (NFS, Gluster, Cefs) is on the development roadmap.

### Container images

The [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) library is used for pulling images from registries.
Currently, it supports Docker [schema 2/version 1](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-1/)
as well as [schema 2/version 2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/).
It also passes all Docker and Kubernetes tests.

### Networking
The Container Network Interface [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) is used for setting up networking for the pods.
Various CNI plugins such as Flannel, Weave and OpenShift-SDN have been tested with CRI-O and are working as expected.

### Monitoring

[conmon](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/tree/master/conmon) is a utility within CRI-O that is used to
monitor the containers, handle logging from the container process, serve attach clients and detects Out Of Memory (OOM)
situations.

### Security

Container security separation policies are provided by a series of tools including SELinux, Capabilities, seccomp,
and other security separation policies as specified in the OCI Specification.
